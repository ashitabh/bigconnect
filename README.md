</p>

Welcome to BigConnect! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bigconnect/bigconnect.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bigconnect/bigconnect)

A multi-model Big Data graph store supporting document, key/value and object models.

Itâ€™s an information-agnostic system where all data that flows into the system is transformed, mapped, enriched and then stored in a logical way using a semantic model of concepts, attributes and relationships. 

Extensible, Massively Scalable, Highly secure. Can be tailored to build solutions that cover most data analytics use cases and industry requirements, from financial analysis to social media and cybersecurity. It runs on-premise, in the cloud, or both.

Features:

* Dynamic data model (concepts, relations, properties, tables), multivalued properties and property metadata support
* Authorizations and visibilities for rows and columns
* Indexing for fast search: full-text, fuzzy, spatial, aggregations
* Async distributed processing pipeline for applying custom logic on import/update/delete operationg
* Cypher query language support
* Super extensible and modular
* Beautiful feature-rich visual explorer
* Developed in Java
* Runs on RocksD/Apache Accumulo and ElasticSearch
