</p>

Welcome to BigConnect! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bigconnect/bigconnect.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bigconnect/bigconnect)
----------------------
[bigconnect.io](https://bigconnect.io)

A massively scalable Big Data graph store designed for holding and querying vast amounts of raw data. 

It can store objects and links with multi-valued properties and raw data, fast queries, aggregations, distributed data processing pipelines and super-strong security (row and property-level).

Can be used to build solutions that cover most data analytics use cases and industry requirements, from financial analysis to social media and cybersecurity. 

Can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud, or both.

Features:

* Dynamic data model (concepts, relations, properties, tables), multivalued properties and property metadata support
* Authorizations and visibilities for rows and columns
* Indexing for fast search: full-text, fuzzy, spatial, aggregations
* Async distributed processing pipeline for applying custom logic on import/update/delete operationg
* Cypher query language support
* Super extensible and modular
* Beautiful feature-rich visual explorer
* Developed in Java
* Runs on RocksDB or Apache Accumulo and ElasticSearch
